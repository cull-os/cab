# Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe,
respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any
person who is willing to contribute to the associated
project. It applies to all "collaborative space", which
is defined as community communications channels (such as
mailing lists, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions
  are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others,
  participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment
  will not be tolerated.

# Apolitical Stance

Politics not directly relevant to the project or community
should not be discussed or mentioned in project spaces.
We are here to enjoy working together on creating software
(with equity and parity, regardless of our background or
identity) not to push personal politics onto others.

# Affective Stance

Ultimately, a "code" of conduct is only a guideline.
Participants are encouraged to become harmless (i.e., being
sans malice) in all of their interactions, for it will make
such ethics and guidelines utterly redundant.
